          By looking at these five exceptionally well informed, accurate, well documented, wells of pure truth, we have learned that humanity is on a downward path, and it's only a matter of time before our time comes to pass. So we must ask ourselves what have we done? Does human expansion cause more harm than good? This article will focus on how we are affecting humanity by making connections through themes of plastic pollution, lead pollution, carbon emissions, and cultural destruction.

          You may have seen those who argue that pollution isn’t real, that we don’t throw trillions of tons of CO2 into the air but we have wildfires in Should We Be More Optimistic About Fighting Climate Change? by Alice Chen, and Vivek Murthy they say, “The impact of climate change hits close to home for us. Our families still live in California and Miami where we each grew up – in neighborhoods at risk from increasing wildfires, drought, hurricanes, and sea level rise” (pars. 5). We are slowly killing ourselves with our negligence and it's affecting our families. Our carbon emissions are causing wildfires and they are killing us. Our oceans are taking a hit too. According to Choking the Oceans with Plastic our author Charles Moore he “was utterly shocked to see the enormous increase in the quantity of [carbon] waste since [his] last trip in 2009” (pars. 2). Our addiction to carbon is causing wildfires, killing marine life and we are even choking on our own toxins.

          We even see “synthetic chemicals unknown before 1950 that we now carry in our bodies” (pars. 6). We eat lead on a daily basis. We drink mercury all the time. These toxins are killing us and “No scientist, environmentalist, entrepreneur, national or international government agency has yet been able to establish a comprehensive way of recycling the plastic trash that covers our land and inevitably blows and washes down to the sea.” (pars. 5). We are affected consistently by our eating habits, eating fish and other marine life causing us to slowly parish as a result. How aren't we affected by what we do? Even our water is made toxic by us, according to Delivering Fresh Water: Critical Infrastructure, Environmental Justice, and Flint, Michigan by Michael Greenberg, “We know that governments sell fresh water to their residential and commercial customers to create local jobs and raise revenue. But if they cannot afford to maintain their systems” (pars 9). Our government is failing to give us clean water and we are being poisoned because of it. The water even looks brown, it's clear we need to make it not brown but there are “no simple solutions” (pars 9). How can we not be to blame when we can’t even make our water not brown? This is like when we pooped in our water and it was terribly brown. It shouldn’t be an issue for our poorest communities that they must drink brown water.

          The poor people too have to deal with all our plastic. The rich people use plastic bags while the poor choke on them to death. According to Banning Plastic Bags Is Great for the World, Right? Not So Fast, “plastic bags have recently gone from a tolerated nuisance to a widely despised and discouraged vice” (pars 1). They are considered the embodiment of evil, and how right they are, “The adverse impacts of plastic bags are undeniable” (pars. 2). These plastic bags are “piling up in landfills, they’re blocking storm drains, littering streets, getting stuck in trees, and contaminating oceans” (pars. 2). To stop this clear threat the government has done the bare minimum “the New York City Council passed a 5-cent-per-bag fee on single-use bags handed out” (pars. 1). Plastic bags are just one part of our “horrible plastic problem” as others say. Charles moore also mentions the impacts on our marine life in his brilliant article Choking the Oceans with Plastic that, “[he] estimated that some 2.3 billion pieces of plastic — from polystyrene foam to tiny fragments and pellets — had flowed from Southern California’s urban centers into its coastal waters in just three days of sampling” (para. 4). Our plastic problem is huge and it's killing us too.

          What of culture? In our pursuit of progress and invitation, how have we trampled on our people? Every take out box, plastic bag, drop of water, every breath and cow fart is killing us. The wise people of the Hawaiian mountains are having their land flattened by us. “the threat they face today is the Thirty Meter Telescope” (pars. 1). They want to build this telescope as an instrument of science, which will have very little impact on the land to observe the stars, a great part of Hawaiian culture which has allowed them to sail the seas for generations. How dare they intrude on their land, “Hawaiians have always felt the need to protect their land” (pars. 1). Though tempting, why stop now and lose the culture that they have worked so hard for.

          In conclusion, progress has no positives and we must stop pursuing knowledge. Our lust for progress will cause our demise. There is a wise Hawaiian motto “UA MAU KE EA O KA ‘AINA I KA PONO” (pars. 1) which translates to the words “The life of the land is preserved in righteousness.” We must feed more money to the government in order to help them stop these horrible deeds and get more of our various energy crystals and weave more tote bags in the styles of traditional native people. Finally we must live off the land, because there's no other way to preserve our world, so we must work with nature rather than tame it.
