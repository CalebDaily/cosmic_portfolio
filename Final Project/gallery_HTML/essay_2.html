          We are infected with a debilitating disease called stupid. You see it everywhere, in the streets, in our leaders, in our homes, and even in our science. To most people this is obvious, it's an absolute fact, because clearly I'm right and everyone else is stupid. They just don’t see it, it's obvious. They are blind. People don’t accept the obvious and instead go against it. It's “the science”, so clearly it's right. We must take action in order to prevent catastrophic events from occurring. Our world is dying and everyone else must panic in the exact way I'm thinking, else they are the embodiment of evil. Clearly this is flawed thinking yet “We Are the Wildfire”: How to Fight the Climate Crisis does just that. Every facet of this article drips with logical fallacies and emotional appeal hidden under highly biased science and ill-informed knowledge. We will look at how “We Are the Wildfire”: How to Fight the Climate Crisis by Naomi Klein fails to support its evidence, and how this paper is biased, and why it's more biased than the average paper, and finally how it fails to do what it set out to do, fight climate change.

          Let us begin with an overview of the paper. The article starts out with describing a date where a protest and disaster happened, an emotional hook of sorts. This then leads into raising climate change as an issue, by describing the people being upset at climate change. As a side note, this is somewhat weak in my opinion as it doesn't state the issue, instead describing how others think it's an issue, which I will build on more in the paper. They then bring up melting ice caps and species dying. Leading into the increase in CO2 levels and the government’s inaction in dealing with it. The rest of the article explains more about the protests and how people are resisting and expressing their problems in various forms as justifications for why they think climate change is bad. An increase in solar production, the dust bowl, and a few other pieces are mentioned as justification for why people are protesting. The article also then goes on to describe The Green New Deal and how it is simply done, by changing all economic and societal systems. Naomi Klein (2019) then describes the soundness of the idea by stating “This vision is not new; its origins can be traced to social movements in ecologically ravaged parts of Ecuador and Nigeria” (paras. 1-21).

          I would say that if you had a brain this article would be clearly terrible, but I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt and take you through the logical process to better understand why I'm so vehemently against how this article is done.  Firstly this article has no sourced information or evidence other than what the author says she’s encountered. I dug deep on this one, Including looking for the other sources of this same article including Princeton University, and other academic sources. I even looked through old and new study groups and miscellaneous websites, such as Studocu, Course Hero, and many more. I even went to the second page of google. Having no links to your evidence and or needing to search far and wide to try and find it, is a very flawed way of convincing your audience to say the least. No one can tell if she is speaking the truth because they can’t see the studies or sources she draws from. As well as that, only 3 paragraphs contain the said unsourced information about the issue. The rest of the article, 18 paragraphs, either contains information from the author directly, or just opinions. The information from the author can’t be trusted either because she has no background in the topic she’s discussing. She’s likely biased to what she’s discussing because she’s a journalist who’s entire job is to get people to view her content. Can you say you would trust a random person on the street who says they “have heard things” and thus knows the complex nuances of quantum mechanics and string theory? I most certainly wouldn’t, so how could other’s? The information is unjustified and unfounded.

          From a scientific perspective even in a basic sense this article doesn’t justify what it says factually, what it does do is a call for action, an emotional plea to do something, that would by definition of course make it biased because it's not looking for the facts or knowledge, instead going for whatever is shiny object in this case, but Let’s look more closely at what the “facts” are saying. Maybe these facts are correct, even if untrustworthy, they could be correct by what others say even if biased. To test this I'm going to pull a couple facts to look at. Although I'm picking two facts, you could argue much the same point for any of the facts presented. For example, Naomi Klein (2019) points out how “Oceans are warming 40% faster than the United Nations predicted five years ago” (paras. 1-21). Well this looks bad, but does she mean 40% faster as in, from 1000 years for a change of a degree, to 600 years to a change of one degree, or does she mean 1 minute of time for a change of 100 degrees to then 0.6 minutes of time for a change of 100 degrees. It’s extremely easy to make this number seem bigger than it is. Though one is a degree per second, the other is a degree per 6 centuries, it’s still a 40% change. This is because there is no context and no sources. Naomi Klein (2019) also presents an argument about the arctic stating; “Jason Box, found that ice in various forms is melting so rapidly that the ‘Arctic biophysical system is now clearly trending away from its 20th-century state and into an unprecedented state, with implications not only within but also beyond the Arctic.’” (paras. 1-21). The cause of this shift is implied but not stated in the article, it's just said the ice caps are melting, but why is the ice melting, and what issues is this causing, and also, what does “trending away” mean? Without context these facts have no ground to stand on, “trending away” could mean the arctic is getting colder, just as it could mean its melting. If the article wants to support its evidence it must be clear and factual.

          Even the facts themselves are flawed, so I suppose it’s possible to argue that the article is still in line with what it’s saying, and that although everything is untrustworthy they are coming from the right place. However, are they coming from the right place? Though this is an opinion, we must ask ourselves, does this article help fight the climate crisis as it’s title suggests? I don’t think it does. The information is disconnected and spread out without context. How can this paper argue to fight climate change when in of itself, it doesn’t understand what climate change is? Fighting blindly would likely do more damage than simply not fighting. There is circular reasoning present, an “argument [that is] one that uses the same statement as both the premise and the conclusion. No new information or justification is introduced.” (Kramer, 2023) The author supports fighting climate change, by showing people fighting climate change. She suffers from the fallacies of statistics. Its stated by National Library Of Medicine that the fallacies of statistics is caused by “mixing of two or more distinct groups that in fact require separate consideration; misuse of percentages, means and graphs; incomplete reporting that suppresses facts; ignoring reality and depending instead on oversimplification” Her information doesn’t match what she's even arguing about, instead it’s vaguely related, and the paper fails to make the connections. Not only that but they are likely changed in order to support her views, because they are without context and she’s biased. She is by national definition illogical. This article spreads incorrect, incoherent information, and therefore does not succeed in anything but rallying people blindly to a cause, and thus making it worse.

          This article describes climate change in the worst way possible, and not only that but it fails to support itself. It doesn’t even explain what climate change is exactly or what solutions would work and especially why. It is fundamentally flawed in multiple ways, from how little evidence it has, to the evidence itself being flawed, to its main point and purpose causing more harm than good, and thus failing at its main goal. In other words, this paper is an insult to logic, spits in the face of science, and feeds the disease we call stupid. Do not use this article for any scientific or logical media, especially to fight climate change.
