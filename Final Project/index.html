                <h3>How Climate Change Will End Us All</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a satirical essay by me. My teacher was not the best at being unbiased. 
                    He used very biased and illogical thought to teach the class, pulling in politics heavily and forcing the use of specific sources. 
                    This was my attempt to circumnavigate the harsh biased restrictions put in place on how I was supposed to write.

                <h3>How to Describe Climate Change In The Worst Way Possible</h3>
                <p>
                    Have you ever looked at something and thought, It can't possibly be that bad, and then it was? Perhaps it was so horrendously bad it was an insult so much so you wrote a paper about it? That is this paper, it describes in logical painful detail just how bad it truly is.
